# Coin

Just a really simple, insecure and incomplete implementation of a blockchain for a cryptocurrency made in Python. The goal of this project is to make a working blockchain currency, keeping it as simple as possible.

## How to run it

- install `requirements.txt` => pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run `miner.py` to become a node and start mining
- Run `wallet.py` to become a user and send transactions (to send transactions you must run a node, in other words, you must run `miner.py` too)
